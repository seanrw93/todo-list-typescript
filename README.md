# Simple Todo List with Typescript

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

This is a simple TypeScript project using Snowpack. The project is a simple to-do list application that allows you to add, remove, and manage your tasks efficiently.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
